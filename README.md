# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) puzzles. It is licensed under the terms of the [GNU GPL v3](https://github.com/phroggster/AoC2020/blob/master/LICENSE.md) (or newer).

The AoC 2020 competition has concluded. I'm doing them now, after-the-fact, to help keep my mind sharp. I strongly encourage you to complete them for yourself, but my solutions are available here for alternative ideas.
